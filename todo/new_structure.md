**Some advantages:**
1. Categories is relatively simplier to understand (maybe) than just dumping all the lists in one place
2. This structure predisposes the modpacker to look at modpack making not just as some bunch of configured mods based on Minecraft, but rather at least partially as a game based on it

**Some disadvantages:**
1. If someone wants to add a backports list for example, I dont even know where to add it in this structure
2. "imposing" complex gamedev structure on the viewer, maybe the viewer just wants to create a kitchen sink pack and doesn't need all these "complications"
