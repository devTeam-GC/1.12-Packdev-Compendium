## Specified Spawning

This mod is an alternative to [InControl](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/in-control) that allows you to add, remove, and modify living entity spawn conditions and spawn groups in a vanilla friendly manner. Various conditions related to entities, biomes, dimensions, height, light, and gamestages can be checked for before spawning while armor, tools, weapons, attributes can be modified after spawning.
