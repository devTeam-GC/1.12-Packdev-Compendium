| **AmbientSounds**[![](/images/curseforge.png)](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ambientsounds)                         | A full sound engine similar to Music Triggers, but for ambient sound effects. Allows setting up what sounds play, when they play, etc based on many conditions. Can be paired with Dynamic Surroundings for that mods visual effects by turning DS's biome sounds off and using your custom sounds with this one instead        |
| **Atlas Project Sound Resources**[![](/images/curseforge.png)](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/atlas-sound-resources) | A mod that simply registers custom OGG sound files into the game. This then allows you to play any of the sounds through the "/playsound" command, or any other method that can trigger sounds. You can also use a resourcepack to replace the sounds with your own                                                             |
| **Dynamic Surroundings**[![](/images/curseforge.png)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-surroundings)              | You all know this mod. But I also want to show you this: [DS Tutorials](https://github.com/OreCruncher/DynamicSurroundings/tree/93040490bef8591a99c25aa154098a97ab271edd/rtd/source/tutorials "DS Tutorials"). It allows you to configure a lot of things in DS. You can even make different fog density per every biome if you want. |
| **Extra Sounds Legacy**[![](/images/curseforge.png)](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/extra-sounds-legacy)             | UI sounds & more                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Music Triggers**[![](/images/curseforge.png)](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/music-triggers)                       | This mod can play music based on in game triggers, allowing you to set up a full soundtrack for your pack                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
