## Using Git to Version Control Your Modpack

**But why would I do that?**

A standard thing to do in software development (and therefore modding too) is to put your source code under version control. If you plan to create mods and do it the right way, you should version control its source code. Today's de-facto standard for this is git, a free version control system. Many mods are relying on GitHub to host their public (open-source) or private (in private repos) source code. Git itself is a command line tool, GitHub is a free hosting service where you can push this code. Using a VCS (Version Control System) has many benefits, I won't list them all but here are a few:

- Easier maintainability

- Ability to collaborate

- Ability to review and understand previous changes of the code

- If a lightning stuck you computer or it blows up, you won't lose your whole codebase

- You can't lose your codebase just by accidentally deleting some files or the whole repo folder


I've seen mod devs abandoning their project because their development folder got accidentally corrupted, it can be very discouraging to lose months' worth of progress. You can avoid this by simply adapting some good practices. It can also greatly benefit you if you are planning an IT career.Â 

## What is Git?

Git is a command line tool to used to version control your (mod's) source code. Read Atlassian's guide to learn more about it https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-git

  

There are many useful and good desktop applications with an user interface for git, my personal recommendation is SourceTree, a free git GUI app. With it, you don't have to deal with the command line: https://sourcetreeapp.com/

Today's most IDEs (Integrated Development Environment) like IntelliJ also offer some git support out of the box.
