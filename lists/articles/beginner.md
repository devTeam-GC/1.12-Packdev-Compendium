## Materials about How to Make Modpacks for Beginners

I highly recommend [this series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJB-Y_FDFQZ7zVl-64Eb3hvhtUdLC20fq). The author goes through the basics of using:
- CraftTweaker, 
- Pillar (a mod for generating your own structures), 
- Modular Machinery,
- Dropt,
- ContentTweaker,
- Scavange,
- Triumph,
- and some other mods.
