| **In Time Presence**[![](/images/curseforge.png)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/in-time-presence)                           | This mod allows pack makers to limit the time that players can spend in foreign dimensions                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                    |

When these lives reach 0, then the player will be set to Spectator mode or the world is deleted depending on the config    | Can be used to transform the death mechanic into a timme limit represented by your remaining lives, or maybe to give players 9 lives in a pack where you play as a cat             |
| **Metamorph**[![](/images/curseforge.png)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/metamorph)                                         | This mod is similar to the Morph mod, but has improved configs and features. You can add additional features with the addon [Metamorph Max](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/metamorph-max) | If used with Metamorph Max, you can force the player to play as an animal (e.g a cat), or maybe turn the player into an animal when they fail at something like [Hardcore Alchemy](https://modrinth.com/modpack/hardcore-alchemy-modpack) does |
| **One Last Day Mod**[![](/images/curseforge.png)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lastdaymod)                                 | This mod makes it to where the sun never comes back up after it goes down                                                                                                                      | Mod to make some atmospheric nighty pack.

But if you remove possibility of setting spawnpoints or make it too hard to set, you can make dying a lot less attractive |
| **Squake**[![](/images/curseforge.png)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/squake)                                               | A Quake-style movement mod for Minecraft.                                                                                                                                                      | It can be used for some roguelike modpack, or a run and gun type pack with a classic movement feel                                                                                 |

| **Time is up**[![](/images/curseforge.png)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/time-is-up)                                       | Time is up adds a timer to each dimensions in the game.

Quickly get back to your portal before the timer reaches 00:00 if you don't want to die !    | Could be used for some kind of temporal traveler pack where players must explore other dimensions for resources, but they are unstable so you have a time limit                    |

| **Trophy Slots**[![](/images/curseforge.png)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/trophy-slots)                                   | Disables slots in your inventory, which you gain back by completing achievements or by using trophies!                                                                                         | For situations where you don't want the change to be permanent, like if your player evolvees over time. Or maybe their inventory increases at the same rate that their health does, showing them getting stronger with time |
| **Vein Dweller**[![](/images/curseforge.png)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/vein-dweller)                                   | Configurable surface damage, or even just Y level based damage, after X ticks have passed                                                                                                      | Could be used in a nuclear apocalypse pack where players take "radiation damage" too close to the surface.
