- Creating new biomes from a blank slate or as a copy of an existing biome
- Removing existing biomes from generation
- Tweaking or completely removing existing decorations and features (grass, flowers, tress, caves, dungeons, etc.)
- Adding new and completely custom decorations to biomes and worlds
- Removing and adding mob spawns to biomes
- Replacing virtually any block placed during generation on a per biome per world basis.
