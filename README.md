# 1.12 Packdev Compendium

**Ultimate mods, tools Compendium for modpack development on 1.12.2.**

1.12 Packdev Compendium aims to help **learn something new** about modpack development for both beginners and advanced and help developers in **generating creative ideas** for their modpacks. 

This Compendium tries to bring together **almost EVERYTHING** known about pack development so if something is missing, your Pull Request or suggestion in Issues can fix it.

# Compendium Structure

Compendium structure of all lists is rather unusual. It's partly based on the 6 Game Design Branches.<br>You can read about what Game Design is and about 6 Game Design Branches in detail here:<br>**[What Game Design is and 6 Game Design Branches](game_design.md)**

I think, such Compendium structure predisposes the modpack developer to look at making modpacks not just as some **bunch of configured mods** based on Minecraft, but rather at least partially as a **game** based on it.

**[Gameplay/System Design](lists/gameplay_system_design.md)**<br>

**[World/Level Design](lists/world_level_design.md)**<br>

**[Graphics and UI/UX](lists/graphics_and_uiux.md)**<br>

**[Narrative Design](lists/narrative_design.md)**<br>

**[Sound Design](lists/sound_design.md)**<br>

**[Useful Utilities](lists/useful_utilities.md)**<br>

**[Optimization](lists/optimization.md)**<br>

**[Other Topics](other_topics.md)**<br>
