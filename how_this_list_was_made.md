## How This List Was Made

In brief, I've often used Modpack Index to find good modpacks and see how they're set up. I recommend practicing such an activity, you can find a lot of interesting mods for yourself.
[Modpack Index Search](https://www.modpackindex.com/modpack/finder?version=1-12-2&mindls=100&included_mods=40350)

Some good modpacks that I also recommend you check out:

- [Underdog](https://www.modpackindex.com/modpack/23547/underdog) *(It uses Craftweaker very extensively, you can look at the modpack's scripts for useful examples on events. This modpack alo has some great examples on using Cave Generator)*
- [Rebirth of the Night](https://www.modpackindex.com/modpack/6256/rebirth-of-the-night-rotn)
- [TREPIDATION](https://www.modpackindex.com/modpack/32030/trepidation)
- [Attack of The Johns](https://www.modpackindex.com/modpack/54510/attack-of-the-johns) *(A unique modpack by Tempest. You should check it out)*
