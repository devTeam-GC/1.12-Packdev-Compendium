## How This List Was Made

In brief, I've often used Modpack Index to find good modpacks and see how they're set up. I recommend practicing such an activity, you can find a lot of interesting mods for yourself.
[Modpack Index Search](https://www.modpackindex.com/modpack/finder?version=1-12-2&mindls=100&included_mods=40350)

Some good modpacks that i recommend you to check:

- [Underdog](https://www.modpackindex.com/modpack/23547/underdog) *(it also uses Crafttweaker very extensive, you can look at modpack's code and learn something new, also this modpack uses Cave Generator, that is also interesting to look how to work with it)*
- [Rebirth of the Night](https://www.modpackindex.com/modpack/6256/rebirth-of-the-night-rotn)
- [TREPIDATION](https://www.modpackindex.com/modpack/32030/trepidation)
- [Attack of The Johns](https://www.modpackindex.com/modpack/54510/attack-of-the-johns) *(unique modpack from Tempest. You need to check it)*
